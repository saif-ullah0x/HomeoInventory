Great points, Saif. Let's break this down so we can write a clear prompt and also understand **what the problems are** and **how to fix them**:

### 🧩 Excel File Import – What’s the Issue?

**Problem:**
Most users (including you) are not uploading the Excel file in a strict predefined format like:

| Name | Potency | Company | Quantity | Location | Bottle Size |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |

But the app expects **exact column headers** and structure. If it doesn’t match, the app fails to read and import the data properly.

**Fix Suggestion:**

* Use **smart detection**: Auto-detect column headers based on keywords like:

  * “Arnica 30” → split into `Name = Arnica`, `Potency = 30`
  * “Masood” or “Kent” → detect as `Company`
* Add a **preview step** after upload to let user map fields manually (like Google Forms does).
* Allow import from **both `.xlsx` and `.csv`** files.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Access to Medicine Stock

**Problem:**
Your family installs the app but they don’t automatically see the shared inventory. Right now, there's no system for sharing access between devices or users.

**Fix Suggestion:**

* Add an “**Add Family Member**” button in settings.
* You (owner) can:

  * Share access by generating a **unique access code or link**
  * Set **permissions**: View-only / Edit
* On the family member’s app:

  * They paste the code or open the shared link → access granted
* **No login system** needed; just link-based sync with your local data or simple Firebase DB.

### 🔧 Prompt (Include All Above in Formal Way)

Here’s the prompt to send:

**Feature Fix & Enhancement Request**

1. **Fix Excel Import Logic:**

   * Right now the app expects a strict Excel format.
   * Instead, enable **smart column detection** or a **manual mapping screen** after upload.
   * Example: split “Arnica 30” into name and potency automatically.
   * Support both `.xlsx` and `.csv` formats.
   * Show a **preview** before final import.

2. **Family Member Access System:**

   * Add an “**Add Family Member**” option in settings.
   * Generate a **unique access link or code** that can be:

     * Shared with others
     * Used to **sync the same medicine stock** on other devices
   * Allow owner to set **permissions** (view or edit).
   * No login system; use lightweight link-based sync.

Would you like me to write UI text or field labels for these new features too?
